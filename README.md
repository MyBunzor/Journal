**Description**: This app is a virtual representation of a journal. The user can input new stories, with a title, a description and indicate his or her mood by choosing "good", "great", "bad" or "horrible". The homescreen of the app shows all inputted stories, with a picture of the mood. When clicked on one of these, the content of the story is loaded in a seperate activity.
